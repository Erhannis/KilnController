Kiln controller.  ESP32, controlled over bluetooth.  (Assuming I don't change my mind before writing the code.)  Comes with two thermocouple readers and controls three heating elements.  Attach thermocouples to appropriate points, attach three SSR-DA60 to HEAT1-HEAT3, wire in 240V, recommended don't attach USB while mains voltage is connected; the 5V sources might conflict - also just seems a little unsafe.

Disclaimer: I have no formal electronics training, and this thing connects to 240V, so like, maybe use this thing away from anything flammable, and on your own head be the results.
